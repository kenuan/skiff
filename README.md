## Skiff

Lightweight todo list manager, providing at-a-glance for projects.

### Installation

1. Copy `include/config.sample.php` to `include/config.php`
2. Edit `include/config.php`
3. Copy `lists/demo.text` to a new file and start editing

### Additional themes

You can have list-specific themes. Just add a CSS file with the list name in the `themes` directory (e.g., `themes/mylist.css`).
